# Mischa
Immersive assistant that helps you be organized and responds with care and concern for your well being. Immersiveness is achieved by creating a room where you are situated in a desk - every time you log on - but are allowed to roam around your room while music plays in the back or, if you would prefer, view a virtual scenery through your windows.


## Features
### Voice to Text
This particular API will help us convert user voice to text. This text will then be processed by the Cloud Natural Language to perform sentiment analysis. This can be useful as a tracker can be built to notice similarities between days where a sentiment of “sadness” was found. 
### Assistant Features
To conduct assistant like activities such as scheduling. Things like: “Schedule Date with Feng Min at Paul Martin’s American Grill”
Intents have machine learning behind them so it can auto categorize what it’s being given in a command.

Which product service to use? A lot of it comes down to whether you’ll be pairing them up with their respective cloud services or not. Seems like things are more seamless if you connect them with their respective cloud services.
### Sentiment Analysis
To perform Sentiment Analysis. The bot-assistant will try to discern why you’re unhappy. Keep track of it.
Google Cloud Natural Language  (GCNL) can help in performing sentiment analysis to regard whether the user has had a positive or negative experience overall.
